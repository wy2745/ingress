Recently web applications have grown explosively with the widespread of internet and networking devices. Many services providers rely on container-base clusters like kubernetes to orchestrate their web services. The container-base clusters bring convenience to applications lifecycle management, but it is disappointing that they do not combine their advantages to acheive a better load balancing performance. This paper observes that for a specific application with diverse resource consumption (such as CPU, memory, etc.) and frequency of different kinds of requests, it is of high possibility that load imbalance between backend servers for different system resources may happen, so problems like performance degradation will be caused ineluctably if too many requests are sent to over-load servers. To address these problems, this paper proposes a dynamic load balance solution based on kubernetes~{\cite{Wilkes2016Borg}} which takes request consumption and server load into account is proposed to reduce the performance problem. Experimental results are given to validate the performance of proposed solution.
