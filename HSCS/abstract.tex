Recently web applications have grown explosively with the widespread of internet and networking devices. Many applications rely on container-base cluster to provide stability and high performance. For a specific application, given thought to diverse resource consumption (such as CPU, memory, etc.) and frequency of different kinds of requests, it is difficult to balance load of servers. So problems like performance degradation will be caused ineluctably if too many requests are sent to over-load servers. In this paper, a dynamic load balance algorithm which takes request consumption and server load into account is proposed to reduce the performance problem. Experimental results are given to validate the performance of proposed algorithm.
